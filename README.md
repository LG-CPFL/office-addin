a company office add-in.
for what purpose?
currently unsure.
## wip
- add to office as addin (will only do anything online i think?)
    - go to admin centre
    - settings > integrated apps > deployed apps > upload custom app
    - app type: office add-in
    - point to manifest xml
- test a lot
- add css file?
